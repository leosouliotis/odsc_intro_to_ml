In this Introduction to Machine Learning with Python session, we will explore key concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning and their applications. We will 
focus on essential data preparation techniques, such as handling missing values, data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing, crucial for ensuring high-quality data.
will implement basic supervised learning algorithms, like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, and understand model evaluation and validation techniques, 
including key metrics and cross-validation. The session will also introduce unsupervised learning with a focus on clustering methods like K-Means. Through hands-on exercises, 
participants will gain practical skills to start building their own machine learning models in Python.
